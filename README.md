# Testing-the-Oswald-Hypothesis-with-European-Country-Level-Data

The Oswald Hypothesis was first introduced by A.J. Oswald in 1996 where he pointed out a correlation between homeownership rate and the unemployment rate on a state level. He used simple LS-Regression on the data of the 1960s and 1990s as well as a LS-Regression on the 20-years-changes of these two rates. In all three Regressions he found a positiv correlation. We want to recreate this experiment with european data from the 2000s and 2010s on a nation level and see if the Hypothesis holds.
We find that the evidence is weak at best before the finacial crisis but becomes more sustainable after it. 

The r-code is used to filter and then save data downloaded from EuroStat as well as to do LS regressions for the years 2006, 2013 and 2019. Plots for these regressions are created and saved as png files.
